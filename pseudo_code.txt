1. make a github repo with src directory, ansible directory and Jenkinsfile
  the src directory contains: 
  - app.py file 
  - requirement file 
  - Dockerfile 
  - Docker-compose
	the ansible directory contains:
  - create-infra.yaml
  - destroy-infra.yaml
2. get my ansible master server ready to run ansible playbook:
- install ansible and git (to be able to clone the repo)
- make a inventory file (with ssh key)
- clone the ansible directory from the github repo
3. run the ansible playbook to get the infra ready against the inventory file i made including:
- installing packages using yum package manager
- cloning the repo i made in github to the production server 
- building an image out of the dockerfile
- pushing that image to dockerhub
4. The Jenkinsfile in the github repo will run as a pipeline on the jenkins server. the pipeline will be triggered by changes in the repo. the pipeline will contain the following:
- get the app from the github repo
- built the app (including requirements) everytime there is a new change 
- unit test?
- run the ansible create-infra.yml playbook to create an updated image in docker hub
- run the new image from docker hub on the production server using docker-compose 
- post: write success on screen 
5. run the jenkinsfile and make sure everything works fine by checking our production server for our app!
